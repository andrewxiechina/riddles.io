![four-in-a-row-objectives-line-up.gif](four-in-a-row-objectives-line-up.gif)

The field (board) has seven columns and six rows. Two players play by alternately dropping a chip down one of the columns. The chip drops to the lowest unoccupied spot in that column. The first player to get four of his own chips in a row, either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal, wins. The game ends in a draw if the whole field is filled before someone wins.
